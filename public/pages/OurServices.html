                  <b>Designing : </b>The system and documents are prepared as
                  per the requirement specifications. This helps us define

              <li>Quicker time to market</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As people have become more tech savvy, businesses have to embrace technology that helps them reach their target market. Increased use of smart phones and tablets has led to development of mobile apps. No doubt, Mobile apps have put business operations into the hands of consumers and it allows user to browse through and place orders from the convenience of their handheld devices. Mobile app consumers are said to expect 5 star experience and immediate response. If your app doesnâ€™t perform to their expectation they will just find another that works, so all you need to do is mobile app testing. Mobile application testing is the foremost thing every app should undergo before they become available to the public. To make sure the application works perfect you must do comprehensive testing and ensure that yourmobile app meets customer expectations and business goals. Mobile app testing is
              too complex as Mobile app testers have to test functionality, usability and consistency of the app across wide range of handheld devices and models, wireless carriers, OS, browsers and location.</p>
              <h4 class="ourservices-sub-header">Need for Mobile App Testing</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Check the basic user experience & navigations</li>
                <li>Operations with memory & control of memory leaks</li>
                <li>Application stability on incoming / outgoing calls & stress/ recovery from failures.</li>
                <li>Intensity of power consumption & sensitivity to charge</li>
                <li>Support for various screen resolutions & screen sizes</li>
                <li>Check Orientation & Connectivity</li>
                <li>Install / remove applications properly in Phone / External memory</li>
                <li>Test Audio Functionality (especially game applications)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Actually, testing a single application across multiple devices running on the same platform and different platform poses unique challenges for testers. Understanding these challenges and developing test strategies that overcome them is the need of the hour. Mobile app testers at ANGLER do test the app for best results.</p>
              <p><b>Functional Testing</b> â€“ To ensures that the application is working as per the requirements. Most of the test conducted for this is driven by the user interface and call flows.</p>
              <p><b>Usability Testing</b> - is carried out to verify if the application is achieving its goals and getting a favorable response from users. This is important as the usability of an application is its key to commercial success</p>
              <p><b>Performance Testing</b> â€“ This testing process is to verify the performance and behavior of the application under certain conditions such as low battery, bad network coverage, low available memory, simultaneous access to applicationâ€™s server by several users and other conditions. Performance of an application can be affected from two sides: applicationâ€™s server side and clientâ€™s side.</p>
              <p><b>Memory Leakage Testing</b> â€“ Memory leakage happens when a computer program or application is unable to manage the memory it is allocated resulting in poor performance of the application and the overall slowdown of the system. As mobile devices have significant constraints of available memory, memory leakage testing is crucial for the proper functioning of an application.</p>
              <p><b>Interrupt Testing</b>- An application while functioning may face several interruptions like incoming calls or network coverage outage and recovery. We have experience & resources who worked on more challenging and rewarding projects. If you need our first rate support service outsources your Mobile App Testing projects & free up your team so as to focus on your core works.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>With the cyber world becoming more-and-more vulnerable to attacks, security is something that cannot be compromised. In order to develop secure applications, security elements such as integrity, confidentiality, authenticity must be considered and tested. Life cycle of any application development must possess security testing to ensure data leakage, flawless functioning, compliance to standards and security vulnerability assessment.
              As security attacks have grown exponentially to succeed in this threatening landscape of technology organizations must consider security testing which prevent the application from vulnerabilities. Web Applications in general will hold sensitive business and customer data, to prevent hackers from entering and damaging your networks and applications you must identify where they are vulnerable and take the corrective measures to prevent as well rectifies the gaps in security.</p>
              <p>
                Our software security testers are skilled enough to protect your application from security violation or unintended penetration. They will help you ensure your app doesnâ€™t fall victim to common vulnerabilities and take a deeper look to identify any weak points hackers can exploit. Any deals with a mobile app, web app, API, or another platform can be taken care based on coverage of the classes of vulnerabilities identified in the OWASP top 10 categories including the following three areas: Insecure Interaction between components, Risky Resource Management and Porous Defenses. We help you assess the gaps and protect your applications through data leak prevention, static and dynamic masking.
